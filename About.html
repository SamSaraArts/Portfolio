                <p>My name is Kristi Howard aka Samsara Arts. I am a 41 year old female that loves many different types of art. I am currently enrolled at the Community College of Denver.
               I am in the Graphic Design Program. I have been drawing for as long as I can remember. I have been tattooing for 4 years now off and on (I am not professional!)
               I will be recieving my Associate's Degree in the Spring of 2024. I am very excited to graduate soon and start working in this field. My favorite things to create is layout
               and Typography but I do enjoy creating work on the Adobe platform in programs such as Photoshop and Illistrator. I currently have 3 cats: Daisy May, Nala Mascara and Cleopatra.
               They are the loves of my life. If you are curious about what Samsara means, it is Tibetian for Chaos.
